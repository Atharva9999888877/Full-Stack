# Full-Stack

project 1)
This project demonstrates the end-to-end development of a full-stack JavaScript web application using the MEVN stack — MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, and Node.js. The project showcases how modern JavaScript technologies can be integrated to create a seamless, scalable, and interactive web solution.

The developed application is a Working Hours Tracker, designed for small businesses to log and manage employee working hours in compliance with labor regulations.

Project 2)
This project (a research-based review) explores the advances in full-stack web development frameworks with a focus on security and compliance. It compares major frameworks like MEAN, MERN, and Django, analyzing how they integrate security protocols, handle compliance requirements, and adopt modern innovations like AI-driven threat detection, blockchain for data integrity, and DevSecOps practices.

Project 3)
It explains how component‑based architectures, virtual DOM, dependency injection, and progressive adoption models improve UI responsiveness, code reuse, and maintainability across diverse application sizes and team skill levels.​
It details Node.js’s event‑driven, non‑blocking I/O and unified language stack for client and server, enabling shared code, streamlined workflows, and high‑performance back‑end services.
