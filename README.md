# Full-Stack
This project demonstrates the end-to-end development of a full-stack JavaScript web application using the MEVN stack â€” MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, and Node.js. The project showcases how modern JavaScript technologies can be integrated to create a seamless, scalable, and interactive web solution.

The developed application is a Working Hours Tracker, designed for small businesses to log and manage employee working hours in compliance with labor regulations.
